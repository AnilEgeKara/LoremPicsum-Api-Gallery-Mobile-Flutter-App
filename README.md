# LoremPicsum Api Gallery Flutter Mobile App

In this project, I used API to get data from Lorem Picsum's image list URL.

I design an AlertDialog to show a specific image with its data that came from API. In this AlertDialog we can rotate the image in x and y dimensions with help of the Transform widget. We can go to the official site of the image by clicking the visit link.
